### About
#### Description
BudgetSIM is a simple budget simulator which allows young children (intended for ages 10-14) to get a general idea of how the United States must manage its budget. Different, life-like events are given to the player and they must decided how to change their budget in order to successfully combat the problem. After each event, the player is scored on three different metrics: Foreign Threat Safety, Emergency Services, and Public Happiness. At the very end, a final score (out of 100) will be displayed based on how well the player managed to combat the situations.

#### Context
This game/simulator was created for the Congressional App Challenge of 2019. It will be submitted to Representative David Joyce of Congressional District OH-14.
