### About
#### Description
BudgetSIM is a simple budget simulator which allows young children (intended for ages 10-14) to get a general idea of how the United States must manage its budget. Different, life-like events are given to the player and they must decided how to change their budget in order to successfully combat the problem. After each event, a score out of 20 will be awarded to the player depending on how close they got to the expected, "perfect" budget. This expected budget is decided based on facts from prior events, research, and intuition to provide an accurate goal to reach. This score can be less than 0 and can actually go down to as low as -80! However, a score of 5 or 6 is the average result when distributing the budget evenly across all categories, so a score of higher than that number should be attempted.

#### Context
This game/simulator was created for the Congressional App Challenge of 2019. It will be submitted to Representative David Joyce of Congressional District OH-14.
